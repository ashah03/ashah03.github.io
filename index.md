**Hi, my name is Adit Shah!** I am an 11th grade student at The Athenian School. I encourage you to check out my [blog](/blog)!

Feel free to contact me about anything at [aditshah00@gmail.com](mailto:aditshah00@gmail.com)!

## Research
Last summer, I performed research at UC Santa Barbara, where I simulated and developed distributed algorithms for multi-drone systems. The final products of my work can be found at my [graduate student mentorâ€™s website](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~blf/RMP_Adit.html). Building on this work, I am currently working on building a [platform](https://github.com/ashah03/kotlin-distributed-framework) that allows researchers to simulate various multi-agent control algorithms and determine their efficacy. To learn more about the rationale and specifications of this project, see my blog posts [here](https://ashah03.github.io/Simulation-Project-1/) and [here](https://ashah03.github.io/Simulation-Project-2/).

## Internships

At [Avi Networks](http://avinetworks.com) (acquired by VMware), I developed a Machine Learning proof of concept for their WAF (Web Application Firewall) product, and developed automation software in Python and Ansible for testing their service on a specific platform. At [Positronics](http://posincorp.com), I demonstrated the efficacy of using ROS to control their [UR5](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur5-robot/) industrial robotic arm, and developed a proof-of-concept for using computer vision with ROS. At [Robolink](https://www.robolink.com/), a robotics education company,  I developed software for Zumi, a CES award-winning robotics kit and developed Machine Learning demos. I also helped run their Maker Faire booth, where I did demonstrations and helped market their products and classes.

## Initiatives

### COVID-19

I am currently working with researchers from Stanford, the University of Waterloo, and USC on to create **Covid Now**: a reliable and real-time news platform about COVID-19. This platform will feature a proprietary algorithm that cross-references all information on reliable websites and displays a reliability score and display relevant information from the most reliable articles I am also currently a mobile and web developer for [Covid Watch](http://covid-watch.org), an organization working to create an open-source contact-tracing smartphone app to alert people who have been in contact with confirmed coronavirus cases.
 
### Gender Equity in STEM
 At my school, I co-founded a STEM gender-equality initiative, [Athenian WiSE](http://athenianwise.org) (Women in Science and Engineering) at my school. Every year, we run an annual event that encourages young women to explore STEM in a hands-on, low-stakes environment.
 
### Robotics
 
I have long participated in robotics competitions, and I am currently a member of First Robotics Competition (FRC) Team 852. This year, I was a member of team's executive board, and I managed all software, including robot driver-control, autonomous, and team apps. As a training and operations lead, I was also responsible for organizing all pre-season team training, developing curriculum and teaching programming sessions. I also oversaw team operations tasks including outreach and competition logistics. I am the recipient of the [Dean's List Semifinalist](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/deans-list-winners) award, which recognizes 10th and 11th grade members of FRC teams for their leadership and dedication.
